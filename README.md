###openGL

Some personal experiments with modern OpenGL. Probably useless for anyone besides me. Repo does not include the necessary libraries. (For example, GLM library is in the include/ folder at the top level of the repo).

Generally followed setup described [here](http://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-1-opening-a-window/).
